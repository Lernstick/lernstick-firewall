Description: Simple firewall to block network access on workstations
 This firewall blocks all outgoing and incoming connections by
 default. Selected network connections can be allowed with two
 whitelists. One for HTTP (Web) URLs and another for network
 connections.
 .
 This firewall script was originally developed to allow selected
 network connections during exams for the "Lernstick Exam
 Environment". A Debian Live based distribution for running exams in a
 stripped down environment. There is nothing in it that prevents it's
 use in other contexts where a simple firewall to block outgoing
 connections is needed.
 .
 This package is not useful as a general firewall. It is intended for
 workstations and not for routers forwarding packets.
