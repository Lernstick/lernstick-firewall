# Some servers have problems with SSL bumping, e.g. because of certificate
# pinning, but work with simple SSL splicing (direct tunneling).
#
# For servers specified in this file Squid will fall back to SSL splicing.
# Servers names must be defined with regular expressions, e.g.
# www\.example\.org
# .example\.org
